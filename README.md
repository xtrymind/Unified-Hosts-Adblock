# Unified Hosts Adblock
Small adblock magisk module using unified host files from Steven Black [(Check out his github for more information)](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)  
##Usage: 
#### First Enable Systemless Hosts in Magisk Manager
 - Open terminal then type:  
 `su`  
 `hosts`
 - Then follow the prompts to install host file of choice
##### OR
 - Open terminal and type:
 `su -c hosts arg1 arg2 arg3`
 - The script will apply your arguments all at once and close. Useful for automation purposes
 - For example: `su -c hosts m wr b`
 - Script will apply the master filter, then your regex whitelist, then your blacklist

#### Whitelist Instructions:
 - Create a text file on sdcard called "whitelist"
 - Either add exact lines you want remove to it -> Run hosts script and choose whitelist option
 - Or add regex for lines you want removed -> Run hosts script and choose whitelist regex option

#### Blacklist Instructions:
 - Create a text file on sdcard called "blacklist"
 - Add exact lines you want to remove it (do not include the 0.0.0.0 -> so for example: "facebook.com")
 - Run hosts script and choose blacklist option

#### unblock Instructions:
 - Create a text file on sdcard called "unblock"
 - Add lines with site ip address alongside site name (example: "151.101.129.140 reddit.com")
 - Run hosts script and choose unblock option
 
#### To Remove Whitelist/Blacklist:
 - Just run hosts script and reinstall host file of choice
